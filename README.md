# COVID-19-Vaccination-Dynamics
This project analyzes the dynamics of COVID-19 Vaccination from December 13th, 2020 - April 5th, 2021. 
Key questions based off on the "Track the Progress of Covid-19 Vaccination: Spring Edition" https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress/tasks?taskId=3897 
data files were also derived from Gabriel Preda's "country_vaccinations.csv"
This project can be used to understand the COVID-19 vaccination trends. 
This project will also allow us to compare countries vaccination trends. This may lead to further investigation by researchers in identifying reasons why certain countries are lacking in vaccination, and what strategies we can learn from other countries.
